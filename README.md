#problem statement

Create a simple tooltip component according to the gif below (on the next page)
On hovering of the button I should show a tooltip.
The component will receive the ‘position‘ of tooltip as prop. In the GIF (see below). We can pass options : “top”, “bottom”, “right”, “left”.
According to the position the tooltip should render at that position.
